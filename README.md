# Image-Recognition-with-Spark-and-DL4J
Distributed Image recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks using Spark and Deeplearning4J. CNN models adapted from examples on [Deeplearning4J](https://deeplearning4j.org). 

This repo contains a maven project with two sub-projects:
## 1) Local
The local project trains the CNNs using the local computer (either with CPU or GPU if available).
## 2) Spark
The Spark project requires a pre-existing Spark cluster. The Spark cluster is used to distribute the training of CNNs using data-parallelism.  
### Deeplearning4J
The project makes use of [Deeplearning4J](https://deeplearning4j.org) to provide an API for constructing, training and evaluating neural networks.
